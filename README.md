Developed predictive models to assess the likelihood of customer default and predict yearly customer income. The default risk model used logistic regression, classification trees, and random forests, with comprehensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to identify key predictors such as work experience, credit to debt ratio, and other debts. It achieved a balanced and accurate classification with a low false negative rate.<br><br>
                                
The income prediction model employed techniques such as shrinkage methods, regression trees, and random forests, identifying the random forests model as the best performer with the lowest mean squared error. This project provided valuable tools for lending institutions to mitigate risk and make informed lending decisions based on customer income estimates.

Skills Used: Logistic Regression, Classification Trees, Random Forests, Regression Models, Shrinkage Methods.
